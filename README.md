Welcome to Advanced Data Journalism for Spring 2025. This repository will eventually hold all the scripts we work through in class as well as additional resources for your learning (many of which you can also find in Canvas). 

Each class period I will commit the code that we work through.

-    Jan 29: [Introduction to sorting, filtering, and summarizing](https://eklucas.github.io/ADJ-S2025/scripts/intro-to-tidyverse.html)
-    Feb 5: [Sorting and filtering review](https://eklucas.github.io/ADJ-S2025/scripts/sorting-filtering-review.html)

Because GitHub is not meant to hold large data files, you will find the data files we use in class on Canvas. 

The [tipsheets](/tipsheets) folder has the following resources: 
-   Tidyverse Cheatsheets: 
	- data-import.pdf
	- data-transformation.pdf
	- data-visualization.pdf
	- lubridate.pdf
	- purrr.pdf
	- strings.pdf
	- tidy.pdf
-   [R-Functions](https://eklucas.github.io/ADJ-S2025/tipsheets/R-Functions.html): a guide to the basic R functions that will be most useful to you in analyzing data (consider this a good list of functions you should master by the end of the semester)
-   [R-dictionary](https://eklucas.github.io/ADJ-S2025/tipsheets/R-dictionary.html): a list of vocabularly that we will use over and over again to refer to various features of the R language
-   [Newsroom Math Crib Sheet.pdf](https://github.com/eklucas/ADJ-S2025/blob/main/tipsheets/Newsroom%20Math%20Crib%20Sheet.pdf): a handy guide to basic newsroom math formulas (I just give this out to everyone I meet)
-   [Putting API keys in your environment.txt](https://github.com/eklucas/ADJ-S2025/blob/main/tipsheets/Putting%20API%20keys%20in%20your%20environment.txt): a guide to using API keys, which will be necessary for Module 4.
